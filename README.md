# WEB SCRAPING

## Bash Script

    The script file simplifies web scraping by providing 
    an easy-to-use interface for finding and utilizing 
    XPaths and web URLs. With this script, users can simply 
    input the desired XPaths and web URL, and the script will 
    automatically pass the information to a Python script 
    and generate an Excel file for further use. This tool 
    makes the process of web scraping more efficient and 
    user-friendly.
